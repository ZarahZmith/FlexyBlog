I began by separating the HTML into sections via CSS by utilizing colored borders I later commented out. Once I knew the main areas' breakdown I was able to adjust the content within. Setting the elements to flex required considering descendancy. I worded with the main elements before attempting adjustments to the header and footer. Media queries added to allow for different views on various screens. SASS used to re-do CSS in a simpler, more organized way.
